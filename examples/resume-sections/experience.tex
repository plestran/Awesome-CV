{Sept. 2012 - June 2017} % Date(s)
{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
%Worked closely with other scientists to develop new methods to numerical model quantum mechanical systems. These techniques were implemented in a commercial software package and resulted in several publications in peer-reviewed journals
\begin{cvitems}
\item{Helped implement a solver for interior eigenvalues in order to model high energy spectroscopies}
\item{Investigated the abilities of various commonly used models to describe new phenomena (out of sample testing)}
\item{Implemented several nonlinear optimization algorithms (DIIS, Newton-Raphson) to converge quantum mechanical wave functions in the open-source software package, Chronus Quantum}
\item{Derived and implemented several schemes to better describe the symmetries of non-relativistic wave functions}
\end{cvitems}
